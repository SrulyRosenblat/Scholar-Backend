# Scholar Backend
## Overveiw
We deployed our backend to Railway, it is set up to auto-redeploy when we push to repo similar to this [article](https://faun.pub/deploy-a-fastapi-website-to-railway-c08df2a1e878). Our backend is made using FastAPI, it relies heavily on OpenAI to power our AI.

## Notes
This was originally from a private repo that included api keys, some code may be misattributed.
